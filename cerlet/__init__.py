    """
    First time enrollment requested by Certmonger

    * "SUBMIT"
    This is called the first time the daemon attempts to send an enrollment
    request to a CA.  The signing data, in PEM form, is provided in the
    environment.  Some of the data from the request is also broken out and
    provided in the environment:
    * CERTMONGER_REQ_SUBJECT
        The subject name from the request, in text form.
    * CERTMONGER_REQ_EMAIL
        Any rfc822Name subject alt name values from the request.
    * CERTMONGER_REQ_HOSTNAME
        Any dNSName subject alt name values from the request.
    * CERTMONGER_REQ_PRINCIPAL
        Any Kerberos principal name subject alt name values from the request.
    * CERTMONGER_CA_PROFILE
        The name of the enrollment profile/template/certtype to use, if one
        was specified.
    * CERTMONGER_CSR
        The actual enrollment request, PKCS#10 format, PEM-encoded.
    * CERTMONGER_CERTIFICATE
        An older certificate, if we were previously issued one.
    These are also present starting with version 0.73:
    * CERTMONGER_CA_NICKNAME
        The name by which the CA is known, and would have been specified to the -c
        option to the "getcert" command.  If your helper is called in multiple CA
        configurations, you may want to use this value to distinguish between them
        in order to provide different behavior.
    * CERTMONGER_SPKAC
        The signing request as a signed public key and challenge (SPKAC).
    * CERTMONGER_SPKI
        The subjectPublicKeyInfo field from the signing request.
    * CERTMONGER_KEY_TYPE
        The type of key included in the signing request.
    These may also be present starting with version 0.77, though you probably
    won't use them:
    * CERTMONGER_SCEP_CA_IDENTIFIER
        An identifier to pass to an SCEP server when requesting its capabilities
        list or copies of it and its CA's certificate.
    * CERTMONGER_PKCSREQ
        An SCEP PKCSReq pkiMessage.  If the daemon is attempting to change keys,
        this will be signed with the old key.
    * CERTMONGER_PKCSREQ_REKEY
        An SCEP PKCSReq pkiMessage.  If the daemon is attempting to change keys,
        this will be signed with the new key, otherwise it is not set.
    * CERTMONGER_GETCERTINITIAL
        An SCEP GetCertInitial pkiMessage.  If the daemon is attempting to change
        keys, this will be signed with the old key.
    * CERTMONGER_GETCERTINITIAL_REKEY
        An SCEP GetCertInitial pkiMessage.  If the daemon is attempting to change
        keys, this will be signed with the new key, otherwise it is not set.
    * CERTMONGER_SCEP_RA_CERTIFICATE
        The SCEP server's RA certificate.
    * CERTMONGER_SCEP_CA_CERTIFICATE
        The SCEP server's CA certificate.
    * CERTMONGER_SCEP_CERTIFICATES
        Additional certificates in the SCEP server's certifying chain.
    These are also present starting with version 0.78:
    * CERTMONGER_REQ_IP_ADDRESS
        Any iPAddress subject alt name values from the request.
    These are also present starting with version 0.79:
    * CERTMONGER_CA_ISSUER
        The requested issuer for enrollment.
    The helper is expected to use this information, along with whatever
    credentials it has or is passed on the command line, to send the signing
    request to the CA.


    * If a certificate is issued, output it in PEM form and exit with status 0.
        See footnote 1 for information about formatting the result.

    * If the client should wait for a period of time, output a "cookie" value and
        exit with status 1.  The daemon will try again later at a time of its
        choosing (the default is currently 7 days).

    * If the request was rejected outright, output an error message, and exit
        with status 2.

    * If there was an error connecting to the server, output an error message and
        exit with status 3.  The daemon will try again later.

    * If the helper requires additional configuration data, output an error
        message and exit with status 4.

    * If the client should wait for a specific period of time (for example, if
        the CA has told it when to try again), output a delay size in seconds, a
        newline, and a "cookie" value, and exit with status 5.  The daemon will try
        again after the specified amount of time has passed.

    * If the helper needs SCEP data, exit with status 16.  Your helper probably
        won't need to do this.

    * If the CA indicates that the client needs to try again using a different
        key pair in the signing request (for example, if its policy limits the
        number of times a particular key pair can be enrolled, or the length of
        time one can be in service), exit with status 17.  The daemon will generate
        a new key pair and try again.

    * If the helper does not understand what is being asked of it, exit with
        status 6.  You should never return this value for "SUBMIT" or "POLL", but
        it is mentioned here so that we can refer to this list later.

    If there are other certificates which the client might need (for example,
    others in the certifying chain), repeat for those.  Note that if there are
    chain certificates but no supplemental root certificates, the root
    certificate should be followed by two blank lines.
